# Virtual Clinic

## Problem Statement & Product Vision

Our team has identified a pressing issue â€“ the challenge of obtaining expert medical advice in various scenarios, such as when medical appointments are scheduled too late or when patients have simple questions that don't necessitate a physical visit. To combat the pitfalls of self-diagnosis from internet sources and to enhance doctor-patient communication, our application breathes life into a virtual clinic. Patients can create tickets detailing their symptoms or queries. These tickets will be promptly assigned to specialized doctors based on their availability and expertise. Subsequently, doctors will provide comprehensive medical records, prescribe necessary medications, or offer guidance on refining the ticket's specialization, even referring patients to other specialists when needed. Furthermore, they can share informative medical articles to empower and educate patients.
