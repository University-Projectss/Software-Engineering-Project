## Patterns Used

# Frontend

We used **Higher Order Component** (HOC) which is a component that receives another component. The HOC contains certain logic that we want to apply to the component that we pass as a parameter. After applying that logic, the HOC returns the element with the additional logic.

# Backend

We used **Model View Controller** (MVC) design pattern which specifies that an application consists of a data model, presentation information, and control information. The pattern requires that each of these be separated into different objects.
